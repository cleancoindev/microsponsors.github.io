      <h2 class="title is-size-3 is-size-4-mobile">Intro</h2>
      <p><em>
        This website is essentially a bulletin board that allows people to transact with one another directly with no middleman, using digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
      </em></p>
      <p>
        Microsponsors "MSPT" tokens represent time slots. You can easily create them yourself using this website. They are compatible with the ERC-721 token standard (also known as "Non-Fungible Tokens")</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the data for Account Registration, the MSPT time slots and their transfer restrictions live on the Ethereum blockchain and are free and open to all to explore and build upon.
      </p>

      <a name="get-started"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; What do I need?</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank">Metamask</a> wallet
      (we will support more wallets later).</a>
      <p>If you are a Creator (seller) of MSPT tokens, you will need a small amount of Ether (ETH) in your wallet to create tokens and select bids.</p>
      <p>If you are a Sponsor (buyer) of MSPT tokens, you will need bidding assets in your wallet: DAI or USDC stablecoins, each of which represent about $1 USD. </p>
      <p>We'll add more bidding assets over time.</p>

      <a name="how-to-register"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; How do I register?</h3>
      <p>Registration is easy and free. It is required for anyone wishing to create MSPT (time slot) tokens. If you don't already have it, install the <a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank">Metamask</a> wallet for Ethereum. From there, <a href="exchange.html?view=registry">visit our website's Registry</a> and you will be prompted to associate your Ethereum account with at least one type of content, such as a social media account or website.
      </p>
      <p>You may associate as many pieces of content with your Ethereum account as you like. We recommend using a separate Ethereum account for your Microsponsors activity (all Registry data is public). We will add more content types over time. Let us know what you want to use!
      </p>
      <p>
      Follow the instructions for verifying each type of content. Once we verify your content, you will be able to create ("mint") MSPT tokens. You may remove any of your verified content at any time.
      </p>

      <a href="#top" class="is-block ms-external-link is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile" style="margin-left: 20px;">↑ TOP</a>

      <a name="what-is-mspt"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; What is an <span class="is-uppercase">MSPT</span> token?</h3>
      <p>An MSPT token represents a time slot. Each MSPT is tied to a piece of validated content claimed by an Ethereum account in our Registry. Validated content can be a web domain, a url, an email address or a social media account.
      <p>
      An MSPT token consists of the following on-chain data fields:
      </p>
      <p class="ms-time-slot">
        <em>{</em>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;minter, <span class="ms-detail">ethereum address of the token's creator</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;owner, <span class="ms-detail">ethereum address of the token's current owner</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;contentId, <span class="ms-detail">the creator's registered, validated content</span> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;propertyName, <span class="ms-detail">short re-usable description of time slot</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;startTime, <span class="ms-detail">timestamp; when the time slot begins</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;endTime, <span class="ms-detail">timestamp; when the time slot ends</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;auctionEndTime, <span class="ms-detail">timestamp; when the auction ends</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;category, <span class="ms-detail">for sorting tokens</span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;isSecondaryTradingEnabled, <span class="ms-detail">can be true or false </span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;federationId, <span class="ms-detail">which registry to check for transfer restrictions</span><br />
        <em>}</em>
      </p>
      <p>Each MSPT token you create will automatically go to auction on this website. There is currently a grace period of 24 hours enforced between the end of the auction and the beginning of the time slot.</p>

      <a href="#top" class="is-block ms-external-link is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile" style="margin-left: 20px;">↑ TOP</a>

      <a name="how-much"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; How much do tokens cost?</h3>
      <p>Each Microsponsors MSPT token is unique and has its own value which will be determined by the open market based on a variety of factors, including the reputation of the seller.
      </p>
      <p>When bidding on MSPTs, it is important to consider the past history of the seller in evaluating whether they are a trustworthy counterparty. Each individual MSPT has a "Comments" section which you can use to communicate with the seller. Use this feature to also look through comments on the seller's past token sales. You may also use the links in the token listing to sort by Creator/Sponsor and see their past activity.
      </p>

      <a href="#top" class="is-block ms-external-link is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile" style="margin-left: 20px;">↑ TOP</a>

      <a name="what-happens-when"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; What exactly happens when I place a bid?</h3>
      <p>By the time you place your bid, you have looked at the seller's past activity and determined that they are a trustworthy counterparty for your bid. Maybe you've even communicated directly using the "Comments" feature on each token.</p>
      <p>When you place your bid, the Microsponsors app generates a "bid order" using the <a href="https://0x.org" target="_blank">0x Protocol</a>, and you are prompted to "sign" it using your wallet in order to verify its authenticity. Your bid is added to the 0x Protocol's network and broadcast to other users ("peers") in the network. There is no fee for bidding on tokens.</p>
      <p>When the seller chooses your bid, they click the "Select Bid" button to end the auction. The 0x Protocol executes the trade via smart contracts on the blockchain, exchanging the seller's MSPT (time slot) token for your bidding assets (stablecoins), in addition to deducting the relevant fees (see the next question for details about fees).</p>

      <a href="#top" class="is-block ms-external-link is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile" style="margin-left: 20px;">↑ TOP</a>

      <a name="auction-end"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; What happens when my auction ends?</h3>
      <p>Bidding is open until the auction ends. Once the auction ends, no more bids are accepted. From that point, the Seller has 8 hours to choose a winning bid by clicking the "Select Bid" button in the auction listing.</p>
      <p>There is no auto-selection of the highest bid at the end of an auction. This is so the Seller can always choose who to transact with (or not), and also because there may be factors other than price that influence a Seller's choice of winner.</p>

      <a href="#top" class="is-block ms-external-link is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile" style="margin-left: 20px;">↑ TOP</a>

      <a name="what-are-fees"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; What are the fees?</h3>
      <p><em class="is-highlight">Registration</em> is free (we pay the "gas"). "Gas" is the term for transaction fees on the Ethereum network that are paid in ETH. Gas prices fluctuate but can be <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank">estimated with this tool</a> or with your wallet.</p>
      <p><em class="is-highlight">Minting.</em> Creating an MSPT token has a low fee currently set at 0.0001 ETH, in addition to the Ethereum network "gas" fee.</p>
      <p><em class="is-highlight">Bidding</em> is free and happens off-chain (you just need to sign your bid via Metamask). There is no Ethereum gas fee for bids.</p>
      <p><em class="is-highlight">Cancelling bids</em> happens on-chain and you only need to pay the Ethereum gas fee for each cancel.</p>
      <p><em class="is-highlight">Auction Sales.</em> When the token Creator selects a winning bid, there is a 1.5% fee to each side. The Creator also pays the Ethereum "gas" plus a small 0x Protocol transaction fee when they accept a winning bid. The 0x Protocol fee is roughly the same as the Ethereum gas fee.</p>

      <a name="do-i-have-to-auction-my-token"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; Do I have to auction my token?</h3>
      <p>
      Many users may only wish to mint time slots and use them elsewhere in a different way. Because they are ERC-721 standard tokens, you can simply mint a token and use the standard functions (for example: transfer) to interact with other users or smart contracts in the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <a href="#top" class="is-block ms-external-link is-size-6 is-size-6-mobile" style="margin-left: 20px;">↑ TOP</a>

      <a name="what-is-gas"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; What is "gas" and what does increasing "gas price" do?</h3>
      <p>"Gas" is the term for transaction fees on the Ethereum network that are paid in ETH. "Gas prices" fluctuate with network usage: the more usage the network gets, the higher the price of gas for your transaction. You can set a higher gas price for your transaction during times of increased network activity.</p>
      <p>When you use Microsponsors with MetaMask, you can use the controls inside of MetaMask to adjust the gas price. One exception is when an MSPT token Creator clicks "Select Bid" to end an auction. There is a warning in the confirmation modal: you cannot adjust the gas price in MetaMask or the transaction will fail. Instead, click on the "Advanced" controls inside of the confirmation modal to adjust the gas price.</p>
      <p>For all other transaction types, you may adjust the gas price directly in MetaMask.</p>

      <a name="why-register"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; Why do I need to register?</h3>
      <p>If you intend to Create (aka "Mint") MSPT tokens and auction them, you need to register your account. If you only intend to buy and/or re-sell other people's tokens, you don't necessarily need to register, but it will probably help other users trust you more.</p>
      <p>Over time, we'll be adding more tools to help you enhance your reputation and get more out of your registered account.</p>
      <p>During this initial phase, we'll be verifying accounts in a centralized process. Over time as we develop the tools necessary to automate this task, it may become possible to do this in a trustless manner with enforcement around clearly stated rules.</p>
      <p>Microsponsors reserves the right to refuse registration for any reason at any time. If a user is removed from the Microsponsors Registry, any tokens they created ("minted") become frozen and unable to trade.
      </p>

      <a name="refunds"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; How do I get a refund?</h3>
      <p>When you transact with sellers on this website there is no middleman. Microsponsors' website is simply a bulletin board that faciliates auctions and trading (kind of like Craigslist, but with auctions built in).
      </p>
      <p>This means there is no central entity between the buyer and the seller. This means fees are very low. It also means that there is no way for Microsponsors to issue refunds. Refunds must be negotiated between buyer and seller directly. Each token has a "Comments" feature you can use for communicating directly with one another and keeping a record of what was agreed upon. The comments section for each token is written to IPFS via <a href="https://3Box.io" target="_blank">3Box.io</a> and cannot be edited or deleted.
      </p>

      <a name="how-can-i-earn-with-referrals"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; How can I earn money with Referrals?</h3>
      <p>The referral program is designed to incentivize users to bring their network along and to help them get registered and transacting on this website as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>Any registered account may refer their friends and colleagues to Microsponsors using any of the "Share Links" in the auction listings or in the Registry.
      </p>
      <p>
      We are currently waiting on the 0x Protocol to implement the type of fee splitting that will support our Referral program. For now, when your friends register using your Referral link, we will record it on the blockchain. And when 0x fee-splitting is ready, we will update our integration and you will begin to collect your Referral fees (expected delivery is end of Q2 2020).
      </p>
      <p>Once it is fully implemented, Referral Fees will be paid directly to the Referrer's Ethereum account at the time of sale using the 0x Protocol (no waiting around -- isn't that cool?!). These referral fees will only apply to auctions on this website. Other venues may choose to implement their own referral programs, or none at all.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to change the rules of the referral program at any time to incentivize new/ different behaviors as things evolve.</p>

      <a name="how-can-i-earn-with-0x"></a>
      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; How can I earn money with the 0x Protocol?</h3>
      <p>Microsponsors is built on top of the <a href="https://0x.org" target="_blank">0x Protocol's</a> off-chain auction bidding and on-chain atomic swaps. Users are charged a small 0x Protocol transaction fee (denominated in ETH) when they buy or sell a Microsponsors token thru our UI. The 0x Protocol incentivizes users to "stake" ZRX tokens and rewards them in ETH collected from these protocol fees. The more ZRX you stake, the more the protocol rewards you will collect.
      </p>
      <p>If you plan to do alot of token purchases through Microsponsors, you have the option to form a ZRX staking pool in order to maximize your 0x protocol reward. To begin, you can also just join an existing staking pool. The more ZRX in your staking pool, the larger your protocol reward.</p>
      <p>The best place to start for now is on the <a href="https://0x.org/zrx/staking" target="_blank">ZRX staking dashboard</a> available here.</p>

      <h3 class="title is-5 is-size-6-mobile ms-title__q">&gt; How do you plan to decentralize?</h3>
      <p>In terms of ownership and governance, the most resilient strategy for the long term is to create a large and diverse coalition of stakeholders who share ownership. In the interest of integrity, we're going to work towards product-market fit and building community first, and then (probably) tokenize ownership.

      <p>In the coming months we'll be publishing more tools to help developers integrate MSPT tokens into other applications. There are four main components you may wish to build on top of:</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/microsponsors/erc-721" target="_blank"><em>1. The MSPT token's smart contract</em> (Github link ↗)</a>. It implements a standard ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Token) interface with a few extra parameters and methods for getting and setting time slot info.
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/microsponsors/registry-contract" target="_blank"><em>2. The Registry smart contract</em> (Github link ↗)</a> is used to record user content verifications. Registry verification associates a piece of content (such as a website or social media account) with a user's Ethereum account.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/microsponsors/registry-contract#path-to-federation" target="_blank"><em>3. Federate with Microsponsors</em> (Github link to more info ↗</a>). If you are an organization that wishes to spin up your own MSPT marketplace or exchange with its own participants and rules around registration, content, etc., this is your best option. It would be a good fit for exchanges, content platforms, freelancing hubs, agencies, media companies, charity organizations, etc. Get in touch with us by emailing hello [at] microsponsors.io.</p>
